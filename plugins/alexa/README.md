# Alexa
This alexa plugin implements an "skill adapter" for Amazon's Alexa
by providing an smarthomeNG-embedded service-endpoint
where alexa can send its recognized voice-commands/directives to.

this plugin provides two features as described here: https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/overviews/understanding-the-smart-home-skill-api
- *AWS lambda skill adapter* - the shipped `aws_lambda.js` does 1:1 forwarding of alexa requests to ...
- *device cloud* - service-endpoint provided by smarthomeNG, called by the lambda skill adapter

# AWS Lambda Function Setup
- logon to https://aws.amazon.com/
- create a lambda-function in the EU-sector (choose EU-Ireland whenever possible to have Alexa both in english & german)
- copy & paste `aws_lambda.js`
- provide the environmental variables as specified in the header of aws_lambda.js
- https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=eu-west-1#/functions?display=list

# Shortcomings / Pitfalls
this plugin/s service does not offer any ssl or authentication!! it is strongly recommended to use a reverse-proxy like nginx with both https-termination and http basic authentication. the shipped `aws_lambda.js` will do HTTPS-calls secured by HTTP Basic Authentication. see `nginx.md` for an example configuration

# Requirements
